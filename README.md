### Hi, I'm Aleksandar.

This is not an entirely useful statement as my name is written in the left part of this page. I
whatsoever checked some other README.md examples on Google (as I wasn't creative enough to write my
own) and most people are doing it, so for once, I've decided to go along.

I've been a geek since very early age, started coding in Pascal in my elementary school and since
then, coded in many different languages and environments.

While that is an incredibly cool story, I still have to say that I'm specialized in building web
apps and I've been doing that for over a decade now.

Aside from being passionate about coding, I'm a guitarist and a relatively bad drummer.

I hate social platforms, I'm not part of them and I hate emojis, which is why you will not see any
here.

Live long and prosper.
