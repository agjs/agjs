Just another dude writing code. I've been a nerd for a long time and been writing code, that mostly worked, since early 2000. I'm the founder of [Programmer Network](https://programmer.network). 
I have an awesome wife, a kid and bunch of guitars. Apart from that, nothing special about me. I like to joke around. That's all.

I'm [streaming on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/programmer_network) every night, so make sure to come around. We've built an [awesome community](https://discord.gg/ysnpXnY7ba) and we are having some great discussions about tech every night.
