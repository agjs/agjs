### Hi, I'm Aleksandar.

I've been a geek since very early age, started coding in Pascal in my elementary school and since then, coded in many different languages in environments.

While that is a incredibly cool story, I still have to say that I'm specialized in building web applications and I've been doing that for over a decade now.
